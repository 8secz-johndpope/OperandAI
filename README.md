# iOS Project

This project is part of Nameless Group Inc. - a way for users to manage their finances better. Of course, all of our top-secret server
functionality is hidden, but the skills I learned by myself to develop this app is what I would like to showcase. Here are a 
few of the screenshots from this app, and it looks great in dark mode for iOS 13!
